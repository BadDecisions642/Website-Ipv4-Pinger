ipv4/website pinger
does whats in the name. i guess i have updated it a bit and added the request timing out error message, it is all magenta colorama but you can change it.. the only different colored output is an error in which the output is red.. example the input for the website or packet size is wrong it will print the error in red.. and if the host is online it will print in green
