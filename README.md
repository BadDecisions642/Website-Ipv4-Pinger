i suppose if you clicked this you will know its function, i guess i will start the project as  i made it, i doubt someone would of pressed on this the instant i made it but in the instance you did then i have not made it yet but i will be making it as i write this , it has no bad purposes and cant harm your device, if you dont beleive me then dont download it?? i dont really care if you dont beleive me just dont message me about false accusations not just because i wont read your messages but because i simply dont care, i will update this readme file as i make it and i will be using colorama as i always do, i think it looks nice and if you run the script then you can use it without importing it manually in the future. unless of course you are publishing your code, either way thats unrelated, i have the base code of this project, no i didnt make it in the time in between this and my last post i just had forgot about this "project", whatever im just rambling at this point, if it doesnt work for me i will update the code, if it works for me and not for you then i wont ðŸ¤—
